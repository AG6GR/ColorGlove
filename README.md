# Palette

Palette was inspired by a desire to improve the way in which the visually impaired interact with color by creating a tool that would allow them to “feel” a tactile representation of color. Our device is used to translate color, a visual input, to tactile output and vice versa. However, our project also forced us to explore ways in which a user could intuitively interpret tactile information corresponding to color. The device functions as assistive technology or an artistic tool, allowing any user to translate between touch and color by “reading” color, which is translated into a physical representation, or by “setting” color on the device which is displayed on an LED on the device. While creating a prototype of our device, we worked to design a simple, elegant, and unobtrusive system for translating the representation of a spectrum of colors.
